Hi! I am a Computer Science PhD student in IIT Hyderabad. I work in programming languages, High Performance Computing, and systems. My research helps programmers build more efficient programs using automated programming tools.

I am currently pursuing my PhD degree from the IIT Hyderabad, where I am advised by [Dr. Jyothi Vedurada](https://jyothivedurada.github.io/). I also have a bachelors from the West Bengal University of Technology (WBUT) in Computer Science and Engineering.
